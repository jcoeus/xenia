### Columbia Engineering Outreach Programs Database Project
This app was built to interact with data pertaining to Columbia Engineering Outreach Programs. In the app, account holding users are capable of adding/editing/deleting events, faculty, student groups and admins. Furthermore, it's possible to create hashtag labels/keywords akin to their use in twitter for better organization. These keywords are also searchable via a search field presented at the home page, projecting all labeled events in the results. Visualization tools were also built to summarize past event data and better plan ahead for future events.
